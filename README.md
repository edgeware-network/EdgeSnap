# Edgeware Network MetaMask Snap for Polkadot

The Edgeware Network MetaMask Snap for Polkadot is a plugin for the MetaMask wallet that allows users to easily interact with Edgeware Network's multi-chain ecosystem. The plugin provides a user-friendly interface for managing EDG tokens, interacting with different parachains, and accessing decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Edgeware Network.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Edgeware Network MetaMask Snap for Polkadot, you will need to have the MetaMask wallet installed in your browser. Once you have installed MetaMask, you can add the Edgeware Snap by following these steps:

1. Open the MetaMask wallet and click on the hamburger menu in the top right corner.
2. Click on "Add Token" and select "Custom Token".
3. In the "Token Contract Address" field, enter "0x6BfF4Fb161347ad7de4A625AE5aa3A1CA7077819" and click "Next".
4. In the "Token Symbol" field, enter "EDG" and in the "Decimal" field, enter "18".
5. Click "Add Tokens" to add the EDG token to your wallet.
6. You can now use the Edgeware Snap to interact with Edgeware-based dApps, manage your EDG tokens, and stake EDG tokens on the Edgeware Network.

## Usage

Once you have added the Edgeware Snap to your MetaMask wallet, you can use it to perform a range of functions, including:

- Sending and receiving EDG tokens
- Staking EDG tokens and participating in network governance
- Interacting with different parachains and accessing dApps built on the Edgeware Network
